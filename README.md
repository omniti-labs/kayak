Using Kayak
===========

Building
--------

 * Set PKGURL to be the source of the OmniOS bits we wish to install with
   kayak, in case it's not the default "omnios" publisher for whatever release
   branch you have checked out.

 * zfs create rpool/kayak_image
 * gmake {PREBUILT_ILLUMOS=<path>} BUILDSEND=rpool/kayak_image <target>

BUILDSEND must be specified.

PREBUILT_ILLUMOS should point to an already-built illumos-omnios of the
version you wish to construct an installer.  It is optional, but the build
will warn you if you do not specify it. The build uses "svccfg-native" if
possible to manipulate SMF on target images without conversing with the host
machine's SMF services.

<target> must be specified.

install-http:
	Builds the <VERSION>.zfs.bz2 file, which is what Kayak uses
	for any install it does. Independent target.

install-tftp:
	Builds the miniroot.gz file, which is what PXE Kayak feeds to
	GRUB or Loader to boot itself on a PXE boot. Independent target.

install-iso:
	Builds both install-{http,tftp} and then proceeds to construct
	<VERSION>.iso using components from both.

install-usb:
	Builds install-iso, and then proceed to construct <VERSION>.usb-dd
	based on the ISO image.

Operation
---------

DHCP server:
 * your server should be set to PXE boot
 * the DHCP server must return and IP, a nextserver and a bootfile
 * the boot file should be the file {{{/boot/grub/pxegrub}}} or {{{/boot/pxeboot}}} from an existing OmniOS system

TFTP server:
 * menu.lst.01<macaddr_just_hex_caps> based on the template provided in this directory should be placed in /tftpboot/ if using grub, or put loader.conf.local in /tftpboot/boot
 * /boot/grub/pxegrub or /boot/pxeboot should be placed in /tftpboot/
 * /platform/i86pc/kernel/amd64/unix should be placed in /tftpboot/omnios/kayak/
 * the miniroot.gz file should be placed in /tftpboot/omnios/kayak/

HTTP server:
 * The system install images should be placed an accessible URL
 * The target system kayak config should be placed at a URL path with the filename <macaddr_just_hex_caps>
